#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

        Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools
    the development and maintennace of high quality software systems.
        Software Engineering is used in designning softwares that are used in various industries, such as banking,
    communication, healthcare, commerce, entertainment. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    i. Development of programming Languages sucha as Fortran and C that layed foundation and basis of other languages.
     This programming languages enabale software engineers to create code that translates into software.

    ii. Establishment of software Engineering as a dicipline in the 1960s which brought about a paradigm shift in the
     field. It recognised software development as formal engineering practice eith structured methodologies.

    iii. Rise of Agile Methodologies in the 2000s which emphasized on flexibility, customer collaboration, iterative development
     as opposed to rigid adn traditional methodologies such as the Waterfal Nethod.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    Software Development Life Cycle involvels the following phases:
     i. Requirements
      Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

    ii. Design 
     Involves creating high-level and detailed designs of both the software architecture and user interface.

    iii. Implementation
     Involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.

    iv. testing
     Involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the required standarsds and functional requirements.

    v. Deployment
     Involves releasing the software to the users.

    vi. Maintenanance
    Involves fixing bugs, updating software, and making changes to the software to meet changing user requirements after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

    i. Waterfall Methodology is a linear and sequential methodology in software development wich includes a serioes of distinct phases, each 
 each of which must be completed before moving th the next.
 Waterfall Methodology is often suited for projects whose requirements are likely not to change and last for a short duration and with meanimal fl;exibily
 making it costly to make changes after the software is deployed.

     ii. Agile Methodoloy is a iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It is also suitable for projects
      with changing requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

i. A Software Developer is responsible for writing, testing and maintaining code that brings software requirements into life.

ii. A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for ensuring that the software meets the required standards and functional requirements.

iii. A Project Manager oversees the project development lifecycle from planning through deliverr ensuring its stays on schedule ,within budget and aligns with business goals.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

i. An IDE is a software suite that combines tools and features to facilitate effecuent and effective coding, debugging and testing within a single environment.
    IDEs are important because they enhance efficiency and productivity, coding, debugging and testing and Cross-lnaguage support.
    Example is: Visual Studio Code and Pycharm.

ii. VCS is a tool for mananging changes to source code overtime.
     VCS enables collaboration, version control, and change tracking, making it easier to integrate changes into different  versions of the same source code and 
     repository without worrying about changes to existing features.
     Example is Git and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

i. Change in Requirements. This can be overcome through effective communication and use of Agile methods in development.

ii. Technical Debt. This occurs when developers struggle to meet deadlines and end up taking shortcuts leading to bugs. 
    This can be overcome by regular refactoring of code and automaing testing.

ii. Tight Deadlines. Developeres sometimes are required to develop and test software with limited time leading to them using shortcuts reducing the software quality.
     This can be overcome by prioritizing tasks based on urgency and impact and practicing time management.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    i. Unit testing
        It involves testing individual modules of a software.
        It ensures that each module works correctly before integrating it with other modules as bugs are detected early.

    ii. Integration testing
        it involves testing interactions bettween different modules.
        It ensures that the modules work together as expected and also identifies Interface issues.

    iii. System testing
        It involves testing the entire software as whole.
        It ensures that the software meets the required functional and non-functional requirements.

    iv. Acceptance testing
        It involves testing the software agains user requirements to ensure it meets users needs.
        It ensures that the software is usable and meets the required standards.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting and refining the input giben to an AI Model in order to elicit the most accurate, reliable  and useful response.
    It enables users to get the most out of AI models by providing them with clear, specific and detailed prompts which leads to Accurate and reliable responses from the AI model.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    Vague Prompt: 'Write a code for me.'
    Improved Prompt: 'Write a python code for me that adds two numbers and outputs the sum and explain the code functionality.'
    The improved prompt is effective as does not only ask the model to write the code but also tell it what the code should do and asks for an explanation of the code.
